Custom map configuration files for ZMR.

This includes:
- Navigation meshes
- Map configs

**Only servers are required to have these.**


Simply place the custom folder inside the game directory.

Structure should then look like this:
- zombie_master_reborn/custom/configs
- zombie_master_reborn/custom/navs


A restart is required for the game to recognize the new search paths.
